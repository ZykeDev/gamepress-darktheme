A dark theme for the [FGO gamepress webiste](https://gamepress.gg/grandorder/). Based on [cicerakes](https://github.com/cicerakes)' discontinued* [userstyle](https://github.com/cicerakes/DarkNight-GamePress/). 
I'll probably update this every now and again.

*Not sure if it's actually discontinued, but the repo _has_ been archived, so...
